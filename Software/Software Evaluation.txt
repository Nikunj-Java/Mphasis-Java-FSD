Software Evolution
*********************************************************************************************
1. Documentation: Enlist Requirenment for a software 
2. Developement: Developer Prepares the Software According to the requirement
3. Testing: This Software must be shared with users to take feedback and if it has error it      must be updated to match the requirement

NECESSITY OF SOTWARE EVOLUTION:
	- Change in requirement with time
	- Environment change
	- Erros and Bugs
	- Security and Risk
	- Must Have New Functionality and Features
	

Stage Of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
	- it has Five stages
	1. Requirement
		- gathering information from customer or from the user.
		- engineer communicates with the client and end-user to know their Idea and 		  about the feature of software
	2. Software Design
		-it is a process in which engineer transfer requirement into working model
		-it help programmer in software coading.
		-it will will make the proccess easy.
		-there are  three types of Software Designing
			A. ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN: Highest Version of System
			B. HIGH-LEVEL DESIGN: focus on how sytem and component implemented
			C. DETAILED DESIGN: it focus on the logical structure of each module 				and its interface to communicate with each module
		
	3. Developing Product
		- it is crucial part of SDLC.
		- it is also known as Implementation Phase
	4. Testing and Integration
		- in this stage we will integrate the modules and will test the overall 		  product by using different technology
	5. Developement and Maintanance
		- When Final Product is Deployed , we will do maintainance of product for any 		  future update  and releases of new features
